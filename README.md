# Astares-Library
Example Project generated using Astares UML Support for Pharo - a simplified library model is used to demo some features

# Overview 

"Astares UML Support" is a private research initiative of T. Bergmann on how to build full applications primarily by modeling and configuration only. This not only includes using UML for the domain modeling but also about process modeling and configuration of a full UI using enriched meta informations. 

This sample project was created with "Astares UML Support" for Pharo using the following steps:

 - modeling the domain model in WhiteStarUML 
 - export the model to XMI
 - open and browser the UML model within Pharo IDE using Astares UML Tools
 - generate source code for a Pharo code project (which is now als available for Tonel format)
 - load the project and use the code directly
 
It is also a nice example that Smalltalk can be used very natural to model the world.
